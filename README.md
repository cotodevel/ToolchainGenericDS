This is the Toolchain Generic DS:

It relies on :
https://github.com/cotodevel/newlib-nano-2/tree/newlibnano2.1-nds

But it's currently on development.


For Project specifics check out the specific project. Remember that such project must support this toolchain for it to work. 
For more technical informacion refer to SPECIFICS

Thanks to:
- Martin Korth extensive gba/nds docs (http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm) most of any DS toolchains/emus out there would not exist without such docs.
- Darkfader for ndstool
